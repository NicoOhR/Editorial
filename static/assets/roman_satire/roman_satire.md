This is not to say that they were not economically productive, or that theyThe Romans were a complex and multifaceted civilization, known for their engineering marvels and military prowess, but also for their intricate social and political systems.

Most Romans lived modestly, their lives shaped by the rhythms of the agricultural seasons and the demands of their local communities. The grandeur of Rome's monuments and the reach of its laws were often distant realities for these citizens, whose concerns were more immediateâ€”ensuring enough food for their families, managing the household, and participating in the local economy.
