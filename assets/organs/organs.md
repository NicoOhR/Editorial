You should probably guage out your organs. Of course I do not claim to know that if you would be better off without your liver or not,
but maybe if you'd lend a ear to old Deleuze and Uncle Guttari, suspend your disbelief and suspicion of psychoanalytics, maybe I'll be
able to convince you that your very own intestine is a very unhelpful construct.
